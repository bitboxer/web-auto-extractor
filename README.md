## This is my fork of [`raine/web-auto-extractor`](https://github.com/raine/web-auto-extractor) where I've fixed some small bugs like null pointer exceptions, because it seem's that the origin project is no longer actively developed.

[`raine/web-auto-extractor`](https://github.com/raine/web-auto-extractor) is very very useful for a web crawler project in which i am involved and solved a lot of problems much better than other libs.

The functionality ist 100% the same as in raine/web-auto-extractor, so you find the documentation there.
